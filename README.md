# hello-world
This repository is for practicing GitHub Flow.

I am a child of God above all, but after that I am a husband to an amazing wife, for whom I am trying to make a better life and world each day. My roots are in eastern Kentucky, and this current branch of life has me closer to south central. Outside of gaming, my interest in tech came from skills I had to learn during my few years in retail computer sales and hardware servicing. I currently work in finance servicing, which is much closer to the stereotypical tech support side. Now I hope to learn the skills that allow me to understand what exactly is going on under the hood, especially when something's going wrong!
